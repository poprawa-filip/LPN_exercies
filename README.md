# LPN_exercies
This repository serves as a solution base for exercises from Learn Prolog Now! online course as means of practising different programming paradigms.
Examples here shall be solved in SWI-Prolog. Some of the examples might be solved in other programming languages of my choice as well (most likely C/Python and a functional language to be chosen later, most likely Haskell).
