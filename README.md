# LPN_exercies
This repository serves as a solution base for tougher exercises from Learn Prolog Now! online course as means of practising different programming paradigms.
Examples here shall be solved in SWI-Prolog as well as in other languages of my choice (most likely it will be C, C++/Python and a functional programming language, most likely Haskell).
